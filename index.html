                <br>While in his timne in rebull Racing he talked about how the car was designed for his teamate Max Verstappen,
                <br>he saited that it wasn't his teamate's fault but the fault of the team only designing two cars that werre designed for one driver when they have two drivers.
                <br>Sadly Checo's contracted ended at the end of the 2024 F1 season and was never renewed for the 2025 season.
